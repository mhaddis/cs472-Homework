Dear Professor,
The link to my home page is https://mhaddis.github.io/cs472-Homework/.
It took me around 4 hours to do this homework. It was challenging since I didn't really get concept of inheritance and Prototype.
I had to read the lecture again and watch some Youtube videos. While working on this homework I got the chance of practicing on
object creation using Object.create() and the keyword new. I also have better understanding on prototype now.
